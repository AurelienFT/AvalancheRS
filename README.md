# AvalancheRS
A Avalanche Platform Rust Library

Inspired from [AvalancheJS](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchejs) to allow you to interact with a node in Rust.

It's my first library so if you have any design proposal or suggestions don't hesitate to open an issue.

This library is still a WIP.
